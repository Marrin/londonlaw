{"name":"Londonlaw","tagline":"Clone of the famous Scotland Yard board game","body":"\r\nLondon Law\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLondon Law is an online multiplayer adaptation of the [classic Scotland Yard\r\nboard game](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/438/scotland-yard)\r\n([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard_board_game)).\r\n\r\nThis repository is based on a copy of the [last known pre-release](http://www.freelists.org/post/londonlaw-users/030-preview-release)\r\n(0.3pre1) of [London Law](http://pessimization.com/software/londonlaw/) released\r\nby the original author Paul Pelzl and contains additional patches to make this\r\ngame work with modern software.\r\n\r\nPlease note: I will not invest much time into development but patches are welcome.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n-------------\r\n* Python\r\n* [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com)\r\n* [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/)\r\n* [zope-interface](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface)\r\n\r\nThe code has been tested with the following versions:\r\n* Python 2.7\r\n* Twisted-13.0.0\r\n* wxPython-3.0.1.1\r\n* zope-interface-4.1.1\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n-------\r\n\r\n0.3.0pre2:\r\n\r\n   * wxPython3.0 compatibility by Olly Betts\r\n   * Fix for newer python-twisted by Hans de Goede\r\n   * Accept custom data directory by Mr Bones\r\n   * More small fixes by Mario Kicherer\r\n\r\n[0.3.0pre1 by Paul Pelzl](http://www.freelists.org/post/londonlaw-users/030-preview-release):\r\n\r\n   * i18n.  Thanks to the efforts of numerous translators, there is\r\n     at least partial support for 11 different languages.\r\n   * AI clients.  Players can request an AI opponent while registering\r\n     for a game.  At the moment there is only a pair of \"Rather Dumb\"\r\n     AI clients available, meant as a proof of concept.\r\n   * Admin client.  There is a text-mode admin client that can be used\r\n     to delete games, eject players, etc.  It has an online help system,\r\n     which is hopefully enough to explain the usage.\r\n\r\n     The admin client won't work without setting up an admin password.\r\n     Create a file called ~/.londonlaw/server/config that looks like\r\n     this:\r\n\r\n         [server]\r\n         admin_password: PASSWORD\r\n         game_expiration: 240\r\n\r\n     Replace PASSWORD with whatever you want.  The game expiration is\r\n     the number of hours after which stale games should be purged.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
